#	These are examples for a square surface with coordinates (0,0) and (5,5)
#	as the south-west and north-east most corners respectively.


	# 1
	PLACE 0,0,NORTH
	MOVE
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 0, 1, NORTH


	# 2
	PLACE 0,0,NORTH
	LEFT
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 0, 0, WEST


	# 3
	PLACE 1,2,EAST
	MOVE
	MOVE
	LEFT
	MOVE
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 3, 3, NORTH


	# 4
	# Invalid position if the surface-coordinates are (0,0) and (5,5)
	PLACE 6,7,SOUTH	
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 3, 3, NORTH (same as last position)
	
	
	# 5
	PLACE 5,5,EAST
	MOVE
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 5, 5, EAST (the last MOVE is ignored, being already on the surface-edge)
	
	
	# 6
	# Invalid direction value, place instruction ignored
	PLACE 4,3,CENTRE	
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 5, 5, EAST (same as last position)
	
	
	# 7
	RIGHT
	MOVE
	REPORT
	# Expected Output: 5, 4, SOUTH
